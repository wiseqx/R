# EM for Document Clustering

This R Script is ging tp solve a document clustering problem using unsupervised learning algorithms
(i.e., soft and hard Expectation Maximization for document clustering.

I. Derive Expectation and Maximisation steps of the hard-EM algorithm for Document
Clustering including all model
parameters that should be learnt and the exact expression that should be used to update these
parameters during the learning process (ie., E step, M step and assignments).

II. Implement the hard-EM (you derived above) and soft-EM. 

III. Set the number of clusters K=4, and run both
the soft-EM and hard-EM algorithms on the provided data.

IV. Perform a PCA on the clusterings and then visualise the obtained clusters with
different colors where x and y axes are the first two principal components.
