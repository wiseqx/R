# Neural Network vs. Perceptron

This R script about to apply a 3-layer Neural Network on a synthetically generated data to
compare its performance with Perceptron. 

I. Load Task3B_train.csv and Task3B_test.csv sets, plot the training data with
classes are marked with different colors, and attach the plot to your report.

II. Run the implementations of Perceptron, calculate the test
error, and plot the test data while the points are colored with their estimated class
labels.

III. Run the 3-layer Neural Network with different values of K
(i.e, number of units in the hidden layer); record testing error for each of them;
and plot the error vs K. Based on this plot, find the best K and
the corresponding model, then plot the test data while the points are colored with
their estimated class labels using the best model.

IV. In a table, report the error rates obtained by the perceptron and all variants of NN.
And bold the best model (with minimum error). 

V. Explain the reason(s) responsible for such difference
between perceptron and a 3-layer NN.
